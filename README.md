# Chess Learn Coordinates
<b>What is it?</b>

Basically, I like Chess and whenever I'm watching some chess tournament and commentators are going "ROOK TO A4 LOOKS PROMISING, BUT THEN KNIGHT TO D6 CREATES A FORK ON C8 AND E4" I cannot simply visualize the position that fast. So I created this website, where I can spend couple minutes a day and try to improve "faster visualization of the chess coordinates" in my head. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# What has been used?
1. Next.js (React)

Requirements:
1. Yarn installed locally

# Setup locally
1. `yarn install && yarn build && yarn dev`
2. Access the website via `localhost:3000`
